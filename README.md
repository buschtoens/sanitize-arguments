sanitize-arguments
==================

Sanitize function arguments the easy way!

```javascript
var sanitize = require("sanitize-arguments");

function Person(name, birthdate, size, pets, ability) {
  sanitize(arguments, [String, Date, Number, Array, Function]);
  
  // Now we can be sure that all arguments are in the right order
  this.properties = { name: name, birthdate: birthdate, size: size, pets: pets, ability: ability };
  
  console.log(this.properties);
}

// Even if someone totally fucks up the order and leaves out some arguments
new Person("silvinci", 180, ["dog", "cat"]);
// we still get the right order:
// { name: "silvinci", size: 180, pets: ["dog", "cat"], birthdate: undefined, ability: undefined }
```

Usage
=====

Very simple. The first argument is your `arguments` object.
The seccond an array of data types showing the desired order.

```javascript
function test(a, b, c, d, e)
  sanitize(arguments, [String, Date, Number, Array, Function]);
  console.log(a, b, c, d, e);
}
```

`sanitize` effectively changes the `arguments` object, since objects are passed as references.
This means, that the function arguments `(a, b, c, d, e)` are effectively changed, too!
That works, because they are linked to the `arguments` object. Pretty awesome, huh?

But there's a downside, you'll have to deal with, when using very loose structure. Consider the following.

```javascript
function test(a, b, c, d, e)
  sanitize(arguments, [String, Date, Number, Array, Function]);
  console.log(a, b, c, d, e);
}
test(42);
```

Here we only pass the parameter `c`. But as it turns out, `c` is `undefined`. Why's that?
Only arguments that were provided when calling the function are linked to the `arguments` object.
And here we only provide the first argument `a`, so we can't effect `c`.

How can we cope with that? `sanitize` not only changes the `arguments` object, but also returns an object like
`{ a: undefined, b: undefined, c: 42, d: undefined, e: undefined }`. And here we have our precious `c`.

Using `sanitize` this non-magic way isn't that ... magic. I know. But there are only two cases in which you have to.

1.  Using a very loose argument structure in which every argument is optional.
2.  "use strict"; Yep. Strict mode disables the link of the `arguments` object and the corresponding arguments.
