sanitize-arguments
==================

Sanitize function arguments the easy way!

```javascript
var sanitize = require("sanitize-arguments");

function Person(name, birthdate, size, pets, ability) {
  sanitize(arguments, [String, Date, Number, Array, Function]);
  
  // Now we can be sure that all arguments are in the right order
  this.properties = { name: name, birthdate: birthdate, size: size, pets: pets, ability: ability };
  
  console.log(this.properties);
}

// Even if someone totally fucks up the order and leaves out some arguments
new Person("silvinci", 180, ["dog", "cat"]);
// we still get the right order:
// { name: "silvinci", size: 180, pets: ["dog", "cat"], birthdate: undefined, ability: undefined }
```

Installation
============
